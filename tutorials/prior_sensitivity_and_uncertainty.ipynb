    "### Damping of high frequency variations\n",
    "The second noticeable difference is that the first fit has much lower amplitude at long baseline. This is because the higher $\\alpha$, while still only midly above unity, means that the prior on $p$ is peaked at low amplitude ($p_0 = 10^{-15}$). Since the signal to noise is poor at large long baseline, $p$ is dominated by the prior. This has two effects on the reconstructed profile: 1) high frequency variations are damped and 2) the quoted uncertainty is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "The damping of high frequency variations is easily understood because the power-spectum is the prior on the reconstructed brightness. The low uncertainty arises because the uncertainty is also determined by power-spectrum in regions of poor signal-to-noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we note that one can try to get an increased uncertainty on the first best_fitution by factoring in the uncertainty on the power-spectrum parameters, which are essentiallly unconstrained by the data (FrankFitter provides a method to draw sets of $p$ from a log-normal approximation to the posterior for $p$). However, little is to be gained from this because the choice of prior, because $\\alpha = 1.05$ is sufficiently constraining that $p$ at large $\\lambda$ never reaches high enough amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A better uncertainty estimate\n",
    "However, all is not lost. The second model produces a more reasonable estimate of the true uncertainty on the profile due to the missing data at long baseline. In the second model the choice of $\\alpha = 1.0$ does not prejudice against variations on scales where there is no data - the prior is flat in log-space. However, the use of strong smoothing, $w_s = 1$, constrains the power-spectrum to be close to a power-law. This provides a sensible extrapolation to long baselines and thus prior on the reconstructed brightness includes a sensible esimtate for the uncertainty on these scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting profile from the second fit thus has a better estimate of the uncertainty. However, this has come with the cost of fitting the high frequency data that is dominated by noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caution!\n",
    "Varying the different parameters associated with the fit offers a way to estimate the error in the reconstructed profile - both by examining how senstive the fit is to the choice of these parameters and by choosing parameters that provide a sensible error estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even so, all of the reconstructed profiles produce a negative intensity in the first gap, and none of the uncertainty regions overlap zero. Since the negative brightness is very likely to be wrong, this points to a remaining systematic uncertainty that is still not accounted for."
